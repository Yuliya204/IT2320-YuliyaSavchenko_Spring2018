<question id="1">
<questiontext>Describe the purpose of AJAX. What advantage does AJAX provide over a traditional HTML form submit.</questiontext>
<answer id="answer1">
  The ajax() method is used to perform an AJAX (asynchronous HTTP) request.
  AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page.
  AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

  Update a web page without reloading the page
  Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
  Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
  Send data to a server - in the background
</answer>
</question>
<question id="2">
<questiontext>Describe the role of JSON and XML with AJAX. </questiontext>
<answer id="answer2">
  For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML:

  Using XML

  Fetch an XML document
  Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
  Extract values and store in variables

  Using JSON

  Fetch a JSON string
  JSON.Parse the JSON string</answer>
</question>
<question id="3">
<questiontext>If you had to choose just one, which would you choose: XML or JSON? Why? </questiontext>
<answer id="answer3">I would choose JSON because:
JSON doesn't use end tag
JSON is shorter
JSON is quicker to read and write
JSON can use arrays
The biggest difference is:
 XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.
 XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
